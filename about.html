            <p> Hi, I’m a 16-year-old programmer from Kaçanik, Kosovo. Currently, I’m in the 10th grade at a local gymnasium. I’m passionate about technology, and my primary focus right now is learning programming. I see it as the key to shaping my future, and I’m committed to developing the skills that will allow me to work in this field professionally.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me hiking. I love being outdoors, exploring new landscapes, and connecting with nature. These hikes offer me both a mental and physical break, and they help me recharge for the next challenge. Alongside my interest in programming, I also have a deep passion for survival skills. I’ve had the privilege of going hunting with older generations, and those experiences have taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, patience, and respect for nature.</p>

    <p>I’m very proud of my roots, and I have a strong sense of patriotism. I care deeply about my country and its future, which is why I can’t stand corruption in any form. I believe that everyone has a role to play in making the world a better place, and I’m dedicated to doing my part in improving my community in any way I can.</p>

       <p> Ultimately, I want to use my skills and passions to contribute to something greater than myself, and I’m always looking for ways to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on those around me.</p>
                
                <p>As a front-end programmer, I focus on creating the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. My job is to make sure the website is visually appealing, easy to use, and functions smoothly. I mainly work with three technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
              <p>
              What I Do
              Building the Structure with HTML:
              I start by using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to create the basic structure of the website. This includes adding elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML provides the foundation, or the "skeleton," of the website, which I can then build upon.
              </p>
              <p>
              Styling with CSS:
              Once the structure is set up, I use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style the website and make it look appealing. With CSS, I control things like colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. I make sure that the website looks great and is easy to read, no matter what device the user is on—whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
              </p><p>
              Adding Interactivity with JavaScript:
              JavaScript is where I bring the website to life. It allows me to add interactive elements like buttons that respond when clicked, forms that provide real-time feedback, or animations that make the site feel more dynamic. JavaScript helps turn a static page into something users can engage with.
              </p><p>
              The Tools I Use
              HTML: I use HTML to build the structure and layout of the webpage, adding elements like text, images, and links.
              </p><p>
              CSS: CSS is how I style the page—choosing colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to make the website visually attractive.
              </p><p>
              JavaScript: JavaScript lets me add interactive features like real-time updates, form validation, and dynamic content changes based on user input.
              </p><p>
              Challenges I Face
              Cross-Browser Compatibility:
              One of the challenges I often face is ensuring that my website looks and works the same across different browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Sometimes, I need to write extra code or use specific techniques to make sure the site works well on all platforms.
              </p><p>
              Responsive Design:
              More people are using smartphones and tablets to browse the web, so I make sure my websites are responsive. This means that the website automatically adjusts its layout and size depending on the device, ensuring a great user experience no matter what screen it’s being viewed on.
              </p><p>
              Performance Optimization:
              Speed is essential, so I work on optimizing the website’s performance by reducing load times. This might involve compressing images, writing efficient code, and removing unnecessary elements to make sure the site loads quickly and efficiently.
              </p><p>
              In conclusion, as a front-end programmer, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites that are functional, visually attractive, and interactive. These tools are the foundation of my work, allowing me to create websites that deliver a great experience for users on any device.</p>
